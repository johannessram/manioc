# Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD)

Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD) is one of the most significant viral diseases affecting cassava (Manihot esculenta), a major staple food crop in tropical and subtropical regions. The disease can lead to severe yield losses and threaten food security, particularly in Africa and parts of Asia.

## Symptoms

CMD is primarily identified by:

- **Mosaic patterns**: A distinctive patchy light and dark green appearance on the leaves due to chlorosis [Cassava Mosaic Symptoms](https://www.plantwise.org/KnowledgeBank/factsheetforfarmers/20137801067).
- **Leaf distortion**: Twisting, curling, or wrinkling of leaves.
- **Reduced leaf size** and **stunted plant growth**.
- In severe cases, plants may fail to develop roots or develop only small, inedible tubers.

## Causal Agents

CMD is caused by several species of **cassava mosaic begomoviruses (CMBs)**, which belong to the family *Geminiviridae*. The most common include:

- **African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV)**
- **East African cassava mosaic virus (EACMV)**

These viruses often occur as **mixed infections**, which can increase the severity of the disease [Cassava Mosaic Virus Complex](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3444987/).

## Transmission

CMD is transmitted in two main ways:

1. **Vegetative propagation**: Through the use of infected cassava stem cuttings.
2. **Insect vector**: By the whitefly (*Bemisia tabaci*), which spreads the virus from plant to plant [Whitefly Transmission of CMD](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2017.01720/full).

## Geographic Distribution

CMD is widespread across sub-Saharan Africa, where it is endemic in many countries. Outbreaks have also been reported in India and Sri Lanka [CMD in Asia](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10658-006-9010-6).

## Management and Control

To mitigate the impact of CMD, the following control measures are recommended:

- **Use of resistant varieties**: Planting cassava varieties that are genetically resistant to CMD [Improved CMD-Resistant Varieties](https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/12193).
- **Phytosanitary measures**: Ensuring disease-free planting materials by using certified clean cuttings.
- **Cultural practices**: Regular monitoring and rogueing (removal) of infected plants.
- **Vector control**: Managing whitefly populations with insecticides or biological control agents.

## Economic Impact

CMD can cause up to **100% yield loss** in susceptible varieties under severe infections, significantly affecting smallholder farmers who rely on cassava for food and income [Economic Impact of CMD](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236021216).
