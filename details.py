# Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD)

Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD) is one of the most significant viral diseases affecting cassava (Manihot esculenta), a major staple food crop in tropical and subtropical regions. The disease can lead to severe yield losses and threaten food security, particularly in Africa and parts of Asia.

## Symptoms

CMD is primarily identified by:

- **Mosaic patterns**: A distinctive patchy light and dark green appearance on the leaves due to chlorosis [Cassava Mosaic Symptoms](https://www.plantwise.org/KnowledgeBank/factsheetforfarmers/20137801067).
- **Leaf distortion**: Twisting, curling, or wrinkling of leaves.
- **Reduced leaf size** and **stunted plant growth**.
- In severe cases, plants may fail to develop roots or develop only small, inedible tubers.

## Causal Agents

CMD is caused by several species of **cassava mosaic begomoviruses (CMBs)**, which belong to the family *Geminiviridae*. The most common include:

- **African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV)**
- **East African cassava mosaic virus (EACMV)**

These viruses often occur as **mixed infections**, which can increase the severity of the disease [Cassava Mosaic Virus Complex](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3444987/).

## Transmission

CMD is transmitted in two main ways:

1. **Vegetative propagation**: Through the use of infected cassava stem cuttings.
2. **Insect vector**: By the whitefly (*Bemisia tabaci*), which spreads the virus from plant to plant [Whitefly Transmission of CMD](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2017.01720/full).

## Management and Control

To mitigate the impact of CMD, the following control measures are recommended:

- **Use of resistant varieties**: Planting cassava varieties that are genetically resistant to CMD [Improved CMD-Resistant Varieties](https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/12193).
- **Phytosanitary measures**: Ensuring disease-free planting materials by using certified clean cuttings.
- **Cultural practices**: Regular monitoring and rogueing (removal) of infected plants.
- **Vector control**: Managing whitefly populations with insecticides or biological control agents.

## Economic Impact

CMD can cause up to **100% yield loss** in susceptible varieties under severe infections, significantly affecting smallholder farmers who rely on cassava for food and income [Economic Impact of CMD](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236021216).

# Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)

Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD) is a major viral disease of cassava (Manihot esculenta) that severely affects root quality and can cause substantial economic losses in East and Central Africa. It is currently one of the biggest threats to cassava production in the region.

## Symptoms

The disease is characterized by:

- **Chlorotic blotches** and yellowing along the leaf veins [CBSD Leaf Symptoms](https://www.plantwise.org/KnowledgeBank/factsheetforfarmers/20127801530).
- **Brown streaks** on the stems, which may appear as dark brown lesions.
- **Necrosis (rotting)** of the storage roots, visible as brown, dry, corky patches when the root is cut open [Root Necrosis in CBSD](https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/109283).
- Plants may appear healthy above ground but still have severe root damage.

## Causal Agents

CBSD is caused by two closely related viruses in the genus *Ipomovirus*, family *Potyviridae*:

- **Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV)**
- **Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV)**

These viruses often co-infect plants, exacerbating the severity of symptoms [Characterization of CBSD Viruses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3917769/).

## Transmission

CBSD spreads through:

1. **Infected planting material**: The viruses are transmitted via stem cuttings.
2. **Whitefly vector**: Specifically *Bemisia tabaci*, the same insect that spreads cassava mosaic viruses [Whitefly as Vector](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2020.00459/full).

## Management and Control

Key strategies to manage CBSD include:

- **Planting resistant or tolerant varieties** [CBSD-Resistant Cassava Varieties](https://www.iita.org/news-item/new-cassava-varieties-help-farmers-combat-cbsd/).
- **Using certified disease-free planting materials**.
- **Early detection and removal** (roguing) of infected plants.
- **Controlling whitefly populations** with integrated pest management (IPM) practices.

## Economic Impact

CBSD can cause **30–100% loss** in marketable roots, particularly when necrosis is severe. Because the roots may look healthy externally but are damaged internally, CBSD is particularly deceptive and damaging to food security [Impact of CBSD on Root Quality](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324929867).

# Cassava Green Mottle Disease

Cassava Green Mottle Disease is a less widespread but notable viral disease affecting cassava (Manihot esculenta), particularly in parts of West Africa. The disease impacts foliage quality and may lead to moderate yield reductions under certain conditions.

## Symptoms

Infected cassava plants show:

- **Green mottle patterns** on the leaves, especially visible under strong light conditions [Green Mottle Symptoms](https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/12192).
- **Leaf deformation**, puckering, and slight curling.
- In some cases, **chlorotic spotting** or vein clearing may be observed.
- Unlike more severe diseases, root symptoms are usually minimal or absent.

## Causal Agent

The disease is caused by the **Cassava green mottle virus (CGMV)**, a member of the *Tobamovirus* genus. This virus is relatively stable and mechanically transmissible — a key difference from other cassava viruses, which rely on insect vectors [CGMV Description](https://gd.eppo.int/taxon/CGMV00).

## Transmission

CGMV is not transmitted by insects but rather through:

1. **Mechanical means**: Via tools or hands contaminated with sap from infected plants.
2. **Vegetative propagation**: Through infected stem cuttings used for planting.

There is no evidence of whitefly (*Bemisia tabaci*) or other insect transmission [Mechanical Transmission of CGMV](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0032579813903221).

## Management and Control

Although CGMV does not typically cause severe losses, the following management practices are recommended:

- **Use of healthy planting material**: Since the virus spreads through cuttings, only symptom-free plants should be propagated.
- **Sanitation of tools**: Cleaning knives, machetes, or pruning shears after use on infected plants helps prevent mechanical transmission.
- **Field hygiene**: Prompt removal of symptomatic plants can reduce in-field virus spread.

Currently, no commercial cassava varieties have been specifically bred for resistance to CGMV.

## Economic Impact

Compared to CMD and CBSD, CGMV generally causes **low to moderate losses**. However, in high-density plantings and poorly managed fields, it can lead to **reduced photosynthetic capacity** and moderate yield penalties, especially if it co-occurs with other diseases [Impact Overview](https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/12192).

# Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB)

Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB) is a major disease of cassava (Manihot esculenta) caused by a bacterial pathogen. It is most prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and frequent rainfall, where it can cause severe damage to both foliage and yield.

## Symptoms

Typical symptoms of CBB include:

- **Angular leaf spots**: Water-soaked lesions with a yellow halo, often on leaf margins or tips [CBB Leaf Symptoms](https://www.plantwise.org/KnowledgeBank/factsheetforfarmers/20147801603).
- **Leaf wilting**: Progressive from tip to base, usually unilateral.
- **Gum exudates**: A sticky, milky substance may appear on petioles and stems.
- **Dieback and stem cankers**: Browning and drying of the shoot tip followed by plant death in severe infections.
- **Leaf drop**: Infected leaves may fall prematurely, reducing photosynthesis and plant vigor.

## Causal Agent

CBB is caused by the bacterium **Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis**, a gram-negative, rod-shaped pathogen [CBB Pathogen Description](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2021.708844/full).

It invades the plant through wounds, stomata, or hydathodes and can spread rapidly under wet conditions.

## Transmission

CBB spreads through:

1. **Infected planting material**: Bacteria reside in cuttings used for propagation.
2. **Rain splash and irrigation**: Waterborne dissemination from plant to plant.
3. **Tools and human activity**: Movement of bacteria on pruning or harvesting equipment.

## Management and Control

Effective management of CBB relies on an integrated approach:

- **Planting resistant or tolerant varieties** [CBB Resistance Breeding](https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/100170).
- **Use of healthy, certified planting materials**.
- **Crop rotation** and **field sanitation** to break the disease cycle.
- **Tool disinfection** to avoid mechanical spread.
- **Avoiding overhead irrigation** or planting in high-moisture zones.

Chemical control is not typically effective or recommended due to environmental concerns and limited systemic action.

## Economic Impact

In severe cases, CBB can cause **yield losses of 20–100%**, especially when outbreaks occur early in the growing season. It also significantly reduces the **marketability of cassava leaves and stems**, which are used as livestock feed and planting material [Economic Analysis of CBB](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344344349).
